TODO list for Perl module Text::Editor::Vip
===========================================


* Backspace with argument > 1 not handled efficiently (at all!)

# Change all so script to OO style

#ClearLine doesn't handle modificaton position properly
	=> well it did
	
#GetText() should return an array when called in array context

* SetSelection must handle the do/undo stack

* I haven't decided yet how to handle erroneous arguments. Croak, Call a user 
	defined function, ignore and log, return error codes !!!
	=> log the call stack when dying
	
# should it be possible to handle the selection directly
	Yes
	
# When an error occures, PrintError is called. That sub doesn't exist and must 
	be set by the buffer creator.

# return an object in a unique package

* Remove reset sub ?

* Should we undo if Do dies?

* use Log4Perl to log stuff

* Add a Set command, in a plugin, that handles the undo stack properly

# move tab related functinos in a plugin

* Put the different types of indenters in a module
	=> Text::Editor::Vip::Plugins::Indenters

* more tests, some are listed as comments
	test plugins

* document plugins
